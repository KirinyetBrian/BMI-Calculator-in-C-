# BMI-Calculator-in-Cpp
A C++program that calculates and displays a person’s body mass index (BMI). The BMI is often used to determine whether a person with a sedentary lifestyle is 
overweight or underweight for his or her height.A person’s BMI is calculated with the following formula:
 BMI = weight / height^2 or BMI = weight / height*height. 
where weight is measured in kgs and height is measured in inches. The program  displays a message indicating whether the person has
optimal weight, is underweight, or is overweight. 
-A sedentary person’s weight is considered to be optimal if his or her BMI is between 18.5 and 25. 
-If the BMI is less than 18.5, the person is considered to be underweight. 
-If the BMI value is greater than 25, the person is considered to be overweight.
